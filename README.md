# Advent of Code Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges implemented in Go.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve the challenges using their programming skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each year, with each day's challenge having its own subdirectory. Inside each day's directory, you will find the Go source code file(s) for the solution, along with any input files or additional resources required.

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding day's directory and execute the Go program using the `go run` command. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.
