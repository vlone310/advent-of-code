# New Year Motivation

As we step into the new year, let's embrace new challenges and opportunities. It's a time to set new goals, learn new technologies, and push ourselves to new heights. ðŸš€

Remember, success is not just about achieving big milestones, but also about the small steps we take every day towards our dreams. Stay focused, stay determined, and never lose sight of your passion. ðŸ’ª

Take this year as a chance to grow, both personally and professionally. Embrace failure as a stepping stone to success and never be afraid to try new things. Surround yourself with positive and supportive people who inspire you to be the best version of yourself. ðŸ‘¥

Believe in your abilities, trust the process, and keep moving forward. Remember, every great achievement starts with a single step. So, let's make this year our best year yet! ðŸŽ‰

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve the challenges using their programming skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each year, with each day's challenge having its own subdirectory. Inside each day's directory, you will find the Go source code file(s) for the solution, along with any input files or additional resources required.

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding day's directory and execute the Go program using the `go run` command. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.
